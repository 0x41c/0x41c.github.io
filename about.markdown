I'm a self-taught programmer with a love for all things "swift".
I've worked on servers, bots, crypto arbitrage, swift runtime, and more.

With a love for reverse engineering, I've been working with other experienced individuals
to learn how to spot flaws in applications/programs, and have been working on exploiting them.

My main goal is to learn to explain everything I learn, because you don't know it enough if you
can't teach it.
