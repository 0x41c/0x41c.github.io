*Welcome to my blog!*

This is where I'll be documenting my experiences as I learn iOS and MacOS development.
I'll be dealing with Objective-C, Swift, and C/C++. I'm also learning reverse engineering.
If you want to join me in the experience while learning this, I would love to hear your thoughts
and responses on my Twitter. I'll aim to be active and respond to as many questions as possible.

Enjoy the read!
